## Update GitHub Repository

### Standard update workflow

From the module root:

```powershell
git status
git pull origin main
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
```

### Release workflow (Forge/GitHub latest assets)

Use the release script to bump version, commit, tag, and push in one step:

```powershell
./scripts/release.ps1 -Version 2.0.24 -Message "Release"
```

What it does:
- Updates `module.json` version
- Creates a commit
- Creates tag `vX.Y.Z`
- Pushes `main` and tag to GitHub

### 2.0.24 highlights

- Fixed ActiveEffect sync status deletion errors caused by non-UUID origins in third-party hook chains.
- Hardened injury Simple Calendar payload normalization for missing/invalid recovery timestamps.
- Added safer cleanup fallback when deleting synced effects fails via embedded-document hooks.

### After pushing

1. Check GitHub Actions and confirm the release workflow succeeds.
2. Confirm the latest Release has `module.json` and `module.zip` assets.
3. Forge will detect updates from the existing `releases/latest` manifest URL.
