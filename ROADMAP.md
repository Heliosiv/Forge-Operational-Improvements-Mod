# Party Operations Roadmap

Designed for survivalist, high-pressure play.

## Phase 1 — Operational Foundation (Immediate)

### Status (February 14, 2026)
- ✅ Roles assignment implemented (Quartermaster, Cartographer, Marshal, Chronicler, Steward)
- ✅ SOP toggle tracking implemented
- ✅ Resource ledger implemented (food, water, torches, ammunition, encumbrance, field supplies)
- ✅ Configurable long-rest upkeep drain implemented
- ✅ Operational readiness + brief output implemented (prep edge, risk tier, bonuses, risks)
- ✅ Phase 2 start: Marching Doctrine presets implemented (Default, Combat-Ready, Tight Corridor, Low-Visibility)
- ✅ Doctrine consequences support added (surprise/ambush guidance + doctrine check prompt)
- ✅ Injury & Recovery scaffold added (field kits, rest tiers, environment modifiers, recovery cycles)
- ✅ Communication discipline scaffold added (signals, code phrases, alert channels, pre-combat briefing)
- ✅ Reputation & Faction ledger scaffold added (standing bands, access pressure, faction notes)
- ✅ Supply line mechanics scaffold added (caches, safehouses, resupply risk, logistics pressure)
- ✅ Base of Operations scaffold added (safehouse/chapel/watchtower/cell with maintenance pressure)
- ✅ Optional automation integration added (Auto/Flags/DAE sync to actor flags and Active Effects)
- ✅ SOP notes added (player-editable per SOP)
- ✅ Environment hazard controls added (GM preset/DC/actor assignment + movement-trigger checks)
- ✅ Upkeep Inputs + Gather/Weather DC edits restricted to GM
- ✅ Water Stores input removed from planning UI
- ⏸️ Operational Strain Meter deferred for now

### 1) Defined Party Roles (Table Infrastructure)
Create fixed operational roles:
- Quartermaster → Tracks rations, ammo, supplies
- Cartographer → Updates map and route history
- Marshal → Tracks marching order and readiness
- Chronicler → Session log
- Steward → Coin, contracts, debts

Mechanics:
- Role bonuses (small mechanical edge)
- Neglect penalties (disorganization consequences)

This builds player accountability.

### 2) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Create written procedures for:
- Camp setup
- Watch rotation
- Dungeon breach protocol
- Urban entry protocol
- Prisoner handling
- Retreat protocol

Chaos control:
- If SOP followed → Advantage on specific checks
- If not → Risk rolls increase

### 3) Resource Tracking System
Implement:
- Food (daily consumption)
- Water
- Torches
- Ammunition
- Encumbrance tiers

Tie scarcity to tension.

## Phase 2 — Tactical Depth Expansion

### 4) Marching Doctrine System
Define:
- Default marching order
- Combat-ready formation
- Low-visibility formation
- Urban tight corridor formation

Allow tactical repositioning at cost of time.

### 5) Injury & Recovery Protocol
Expand existing injury play with operational structure:
- Field stabilization kit tracking
- Rest tier system (short, protected, fortified)
- Environmental recovery modifiers

Make recovery strategic, not automatic.

### 6) Communication Discipline
Add:
- Silent signals
- Code phrases
- Signal flares / bells
- Pre-combat plans

Reward preparation.

## Phase 3 — Strategic Campaign Layer

### 7) Reputation & Faction Ledger
Track:
- Religious standing (Last Light)
- Nobility alignment
- Criminal reputation
- Peasant sentiment

Let operations impact faction access.

### 8) Supply Line Mechanics
Introduce:
- Remote caches
- Friendly safehouses
- Risk of resupply missions
- Caravan escort jobs

Nordhofne becomes logistically alive.

### 9) Base of Operations
Eventually allow:
- Safehouse
- Chapel
- Watchtower
- Underground cell

Add maintenance costs and risk of discovery.

## Phase 4 — Advanced Systems

### 10) Operational Strain Meter (Deferred)
Track:
- Fatigue
- Paranoia
- Moral fracture
- Cohesion

Trigger events when thresholds hit.

Status:
- Deferred pending further playtest signal; environment hazard system is active in its place.

### 11) Intelligence & Recon Layer
Before major missions:
- Recon checks
- Rumor gathering
- Bribery networks
- Spy placement

Success reduces unknowns.

### 12) War-Scale Engagement Framework
For House conflicts:
- Unit abstraction system
- Influence points
- Resource drain over time
- Territory control map

Keep war manageable without wargame bloat.

## Foundry Implementation Suggestions

Create:
- Journal template: Operational Log
- Actor sheet: Party Ledger
- Roll table: Operational Mishaps
- Custom clock tracker: Strain Meter (optional, deferred)
- Scene flags: Supply drain per long rest

Keep UI minimal and systemic.

## Design Philosophy for This Campaign

Given the Dark Host arc, brewing political war, survivalist tone, and low-magic pressure, Party Operations should:
- Increase tension
- Reward preparation
- Punish arrogance
- Avoid micromanagement fatigue

Operational depth should support narrative weight, not replace it.

## Next Up (Immediate Priority)

1. Base of Operations scaffold (safehouse / chapel / watchtower / underground cell + maintenance pressure)
2. Intelligence & Recon Layer (recon checks, rumor network, bribes, spy placement)
3. Supply line mechanics extension (cache risk profiles, escort contracts, scarcity events)

These three systems extend the now-established baseline into strategic persistence and mission prep depth.
